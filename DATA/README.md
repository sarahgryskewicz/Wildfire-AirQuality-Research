## IMPROVE DATA
The IMPROVE network began in 1988 (20 sites) with the purpose of monitoring air quality largely in national parks. Today, over 100 more monitoring sites have been deployed than they were in 1988, 
counting both the IMPROVE sites and the IMPROVE Protocol (overseen by other agencies [e.g. tribal, national, etc.]) sites, in states all over the United States with a large number 
of these sites remaining in the western United States. </p>

The data I used from the IMPROVE network is included in this directory. More information on the IMPROVE network as well as the database can be found below.

## AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH DATA
Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a measure of a column of air and its aerosols in the column. This measure quantifies and allows us to understand the amount of light that is scattered and absorbed by these particles in the column.

The AOD data that I used is from the **S**uomi **N**ational **P**olar-Orbiting **P**artnership (SNPP) **V**isible **I**nfrared **I**maging **R**adiometer **S**uite (VIIRS) instrument. Information on the instrument and the data archive can be found below.
