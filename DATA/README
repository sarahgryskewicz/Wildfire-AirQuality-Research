# The datafile I used is too large. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) data that I used is from the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument.

Aerosol optical depth is a measure of a column of air and its aerosols in the column. This measure quantifies and allows us to understand the amount of light that is scattered and absorbed by these particles in the column.
