# Wildfire-Air Quality Research
***
Hello! This is a collection of all the work/code I completed during my time at Coloarado State University (CSU) as a 2024 summer research intern. 

My summer research project was focused on investigating the 2023 Canadian wildfires and the impacts that they had on the northeastern United States. I was mentored by Dr. Jenny Hand and Dr. Bonne Ford of the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) at CSU. Conducting this research, I primarily worked with the IMPROVE (**I**nteragency **M**onitoring of **PRO**tected **V**isual **E**nvironments) ground-based network PM2.5 and PM10 speciated aerosol measurements. It is therefore also worth stating that my project was heavily involved in the realm of atmospheric chemistry. This was incredibly interesting to me since I had not worked with concepts and processes related to atmospheric chemistry until I began my research.

I used various databases from ground-based surface stations and satellite measurements, specifically from the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite. By combining ground and satellite measurements, I was able to investigate surface conditions and how they compared to satellite retrievals. This approach allowed for a fine-scale investigation into the 2023 wildfire impacts on the Northeast. More information on these resources can be found in the data directory.
