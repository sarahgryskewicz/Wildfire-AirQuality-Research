# CSU REU Summer 2024
Hello! This is a collection of all the work/code I completed during my time at Coloarado State University as a summer intern. This is also my first time using a GitHub account, specifically my first time designing my own repository, so bear with me!

My summer research was focused on investigating the 2023 Canadian wildfires and the impacts that they had on the northeastern United States. Conducting this research, I used the IMPROVE (**I**nteragency **M**onitoring of **PRO**tected **V**isual **E**nvironments) ground-based network PM2.5 and PM10 speciated aerosol measurements.
